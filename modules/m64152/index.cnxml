<para id="fs-idp115141712">We present the history of the U.S. current account balance in recent decades in several different ways. <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C23_004"/> (a) shows the current account balance and the merchandise trade balance—the latter of which is simply the balance on goods exported versus imported—in dollar terms. <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C23_004"/> (b) shows the current account balance and merchandise account balance yet again, this time as a share of the GDP for that year. By dividing the trade deficit in each year by GDP in that year, <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C23_004"/> (b) factors out both inflation and growth in the real economy.</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C23_004"><title>Current Account Balance and Merchandise Trade Balance, 1960–2020</title><media id="fs-idm51387392" alt="The first graph shows the current account and merchandise trade balance in nominal dollars.

The second graph shows the current account and merchandise trade balance as percentages of GDP. Both dropped around 1986, but increased gradually until 1991, when both dropped again with the low around 2005.

<caption>(a) The current account balance and the merchandise trade balance in billions of dollars from 1960 to 2020. The merchandise trade balance is the trade balance on goods only. If the lines are above zero dollars, the United States was running a positive trade balance and current account balance. If the lines fall below zero dollars, the United States is running a trade deficit and a deficit in its current account balance. (b) This shows the same items—trade balance and current account balance—in relationship to the size of the U.S. economy, or GDP, from 1960 to 2020.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm48480336">By either measure, the U.S. balance of trade pattern is clear. From the 1960s into the 1970s, the U.S. economy had mostly small trade surpluses—that is, the graphs in <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C23_004"/> show positive numbers. However, starting in the 1980s, the trade deficit increased rapidly, and after a tiny surplus in 1991, the current account trade deficit became even larger in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s. However, the trade deficit declined in 2009 after the recession had taken hold, then rebounded partially in 2010 and remained stable up through 2019, before falling again in 2020.</para>

<para id="fs-idm80737600"><link target-id="Table_23_04"/> shows the U.S. trade picture in 2013 compared with some other economies from around the world. While the U.S. economy has consistently run trade deficits in recent years, Japan and many European nations, among them France and Germany, have consistently run trade surpluses. Some of the other countries listed include Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America; Nigeria, along with South Africa competing to be the largest economy in Africa; and China, India, and Korea. The first column offers one measure of an economy's globalization: <term id="term-00001">exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP</term>. The second column shows the trade balance. Usually, most countries have trade surpluses or deficits that are less than 5% of GDP. As you can see, the U.S. current account balance is –2.6% of GDP, while Germany's is 8.4% of GDP.</para><table id="Table_23_04" summary="This table has three columns and thirteen rows.

<para id="fs-idm101438464">The United States developed large trade surpluses in the early 1980s, swung back to a tiny trade surplus in 1991, and then had even larger trade deficits in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As we will see below, a trade deficit necessarily means a net inflow of financial capital from abroad, while a trade surplus necessarily means a net outflow of financial capital from an economy to other countries.</para>
