<para id="ch24mod05_p01">The AD/AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the three macroeconomic goals of growth, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">unemployment</term>, and low <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">inflation</term>. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough to accommodate both the Keynes’ law approach that focuses on aggregate demand and the short run, while also including the Say’s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the long run. These advantages are considerable. Every model is a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the context of the AD/AS model, the three macroeconomic goals arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In this module, we consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.</para><section id="ch24mod05_01">
<title>Growth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram</title><para id="ch24mod05_p02">In the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the “full employment level of GDP”) will gradually shift to the right over time as well. Earlier <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C24_013" document="m63808"/> (a) showed a pattern of economic growth over three years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right each year. However, the factors that determine the speed of this long-term economic growth rate—like investment in physical and human capital, technology, and whether an economy can take advantage of catch-up growth—do not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram.</para><para id="ch24mod05_p03">In the short run, GDP falls and rises in every economy, as the economy dips into recession or expands out of recession. The AD/AS diagram illustrates recessions when the equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially below potential GDP, as we see at the equilibrium point E<sub>0</sub> in <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C24_008" document="m63809"/>. From another standpoint, in years of resurgent economic growth the equilibrium will typically be close to potential GDP, as equilibrium point E<sub>1</sub> in that earlier figure shows.</para></section>

<section id="ch24mod05_02">
<title>Unemployment in the AD/AS Diagram</title>
<para id="ch24mod05_p04">We described two types of unemployment in the <link document="m64096">Unemployment</link> chapter. Short run variations in unemployment (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">cyclical unemployment</term>) are caused by the business cycle as the economy expands and contracts. Over the long run, in the United States, the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5% (give or take one percentage point or so), when the economy is healthy. In many of the national economies across Europe, the unemployment rate in recent decades has only dropped to about 10% or a bit lower, even in good economic years. We call this baseline level of unemployment that occurs year-in and year-out the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">natural rate of unemployment</term> and we determine it by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market. Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies, depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy.</para><para id="ch24mod05_p06">The AD/AS diagram shows cyclical unemployment by how close the economy is to the potential or full GDP employment level. Returning to <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C24_008" document="m63809"/>, relatively low cyclical unemployment for an economy occurs when the level of output is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point E<sub>1</sub>. Conversely, high cyclical unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at the equilibrium point E<sub>0</sub>. Although we do not show the factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment separately in the AD/AS model, they are implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or full employment GDP in a given economy.</para></section>

<section id="ch24mod05_03">
<title>Inflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram</title>
<para id="ch24mod05_p07">Inflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation rates have typically occurred either during or just after economic booms: for example, the biggest spurts of inflation in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century followed the wartime booms of World War I and World War II. Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline during recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became negative—a situation called “deflation”—during the Great Depression. Even during the relatively short 1991-1992 recession, the inflation rate declined from 5.4% in 1990 to 3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short 2001 recession, the rate of inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007–2009, the inflation rate declined from 3.8% in 2008 to –0.4% in 2009. Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation that lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid–1980s, inflation does not seem to have had any long-term trend to be substantially higher. Instead, it has stayed in the 1–5% range annually.</para><para id="ch24mod05_p09">The AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the AS curve's steep portion. In <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C24_015"/> (a), there is a shift of aggregate demand to the right. The new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> is clearly at a higher price level than the original equilibrium E<sub>0</sub>. In this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has soared so high that firms in the economy are not capable of producing additional goods, because labor and physical capital are fully employed, and so additional increases in aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price level.</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C24_015"><title>Sources of Inflationary Pressure in the AD/AS Model</title><media id="mCNX_Econ_C24_015" alt="The two graphs show how a shift in aggregate demand or supply can cause inflationary pressure. The graph on the left shows two aggregate demand curves to represent a shift to the right. The graph on the right shows two aggregate supply curves to represent a shift to the left.">

<caption>(a) A shift in aggregate demand, from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the original equilibrium. (b) A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub>, will lead to a lower real GDP and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) is at a higher price level (P<sub>1</sub>), while the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) is at the lower price level (P<sub>0</sub>).</caption></figure><para id="ch24mod05_p10">An alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most firms across the economy—perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor—and causes the aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C24_015"/> (b), the SRAS curve's shift to the left also increases the price level from P<sub>0</sub> at the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) to a higher price level of P<sub>1</sub> at the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>). In effect, the rise in input prices ends up, after the final output is produced and sold, passing along in the form of a higher price level for outputs.</para><para id="ch24mod05_p11">The AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price level. It does not address the question of what would cause inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain itself for several years. There are two explanations for why inflation may persist over time. One way that continual inflationary price increases can occur is if the government continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way that keeps pushing the AD curve when it is already in the SRAS curve's steep portion. A second possibility is that, if inflation has been occurring for several years, people might begin to expect a certain level of inflation. If they do, then these expectations will cause prices, wages and interest rates to increase annually by the amount of the inflation expected. These two reasons are interrelated, because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not show these patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.</para></section>

<title>Importance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model</title><para id="ch24mod05_p12">Macroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different concepts. For example, start with the three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. Aggregate demand has four elements: consumption, investment, government spending, and exports less imports. Aggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher price level for outputs. Finally, a wide array of economic events and policy decisions can affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business confidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.</para>
<para id="ch24mod05_p13">The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is one of the fundamental diagrams in this course (like the budget constraint diagram that we introduced in the <link document="m63593">Choice in a World of Scarcity</link> chapter and the supply and demand diagram in the <link document="m63600">Demand and Supply</link> chapter) because it provides an overall framework for bringing these factors together in one diagram. Some version of the AD/AS model will appear in every chapter in the rest of this book.</para></section>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="ch24mod05_p14">Cyclical unemployment is relatively large in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is substantially below potential GDP. Cyclical unemployment is small in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is near potential GDP. The natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the labor market institutions of the economy, is built into what economists mean by potential GDP, but does not otherwise appear in an AD/AS diagram. The AD/AS framework shows pressures for inflation to rise or fall when the movement from one equilibrium to another causes the price level to rise or to fall. The balance of trade does not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram, but it appears indirectly in several ways. Increases in exports or declines in imports can cause shifts in AD. Changes in the price of key imported inputs to production, like oil, can cause shifts in AS. The AD/AS model is the key model we use in this book to understand macroeconomic issues.</para></section>
