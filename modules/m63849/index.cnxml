  <title>The Great Recession</title>
  <para id="ch25mod00_p01">The 2008-2009 Great Recession hit the U.S. economy hard. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of unemployed Americans rose from 6.8 million in May 2007 to 15.4 million in October 2009. During that time, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 170,000 small businesses closed. Mass layoffs peaked in February 2009 when employers gave 326,392 workers notice. U.S. productivity and output fell as well. Job losses, declining home values, declining incomes, and uncertainty about the future caused consumption expenditures to decrease. According to the BLS, household spending dropped by 7.8%.</para><para id="ch25mod00_p02">Home foreclosures and the meltdown in U.S. financial markets called for immediate action by Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve Bank. For example, the government implemented programs such as the American Restoration and Recovery Act to help millions of people by providing tax credits for homebuyers, paying “cash for clunkers,” and extending unemployment benefits.  From cutting back on spending, filing for unemployment, and losing homes, millions of people were affected by the recession. While the United States is now on the path to recovery, people will feel the impact for many years to come.
  </para><para id="ch25mod00_p03">What caused this recession and what prevented the economy from spiraling further into another depression? Policymakers looked to the lessons learned from the 1930s Great Depression and to John Maynard Keynes' models to analyze the causes and find solutions to the country’s economic woes. The Keynesian perspective is the subject of this chapter.</para></note>

  <para id="ch26mod00_p05">We have learned that the level of economic activity, for example output, employment, and spending, tends to grow over time. In <link document="m63849">The Keynesian Perspective</link> we learned the reasons for this trend. <link document="m63717">The Macroeconomic Perspective</link> pointed out that the economy tends to cycle around the long-run trend. In other words, the economy does not always grow at its average growth rate. Sometimes economic activity grows at the trend rate, sometimes it grows more than the trend, sometimes it grows less than the trend, and sometimes it actually declines. You can see this cyclical behavior in <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C25_027"/>.</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_027"><title>U.S. Real Domestic Product, Percent Changes 1930–2020</title><media id="mCNX_Econ_C25_027" alt="The line graph shows how GDP percentages have fluctuated since 1930 with the highest percentage in the early 1940s and the lowest percentage in the early 1930s (closely followed by the mid 1940s).">

This chapter (on the Keynesian perspective) and <link document="m63798">The Neoclassical Perspective</link> explore those questions from two different points of view, building on what we learned in <link document="m63805">The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model</link>.</para><media id="fs-idm24563424" alt="A graph x axis has years from 1945 until present in 5-year increments.
