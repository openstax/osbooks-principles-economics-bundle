<para id="fs-idp3165600">Let’s begin this discussion with a single economic event. It might be an event that affects demand, like a change in income, population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or expectations about future prices. It might be an event that affects supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or technology, or government policies that affect production. How does this economic event affect equilibrium price and quantity? We will analyze this question using a four-step process.</para>
<para id="fs-idm52395200">Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change took place. To establish the model requires four standard pieces of information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the demand curve is negative; the law of supply, which tells us that the slope of the supply curve is positive; the shift variables for demand; and the shift variables for supply. From this model, find the initial equilibrium values for price and quantity.</para>
<para id="fs-idp55222320">Step 2. Decide whether the economic change you are analyzing affects demand or supply. In other words, does the event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply factors?</para><para id="fs-idp24321312">Step 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the curve to shift to the right or to the left, and sketch the new demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the event increase or decrease the amount consumers want to buy or producers want to sell?</para>
<para id="fs-idm53526400">Step 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original equilibrium price and quantity to the new equilibrium price and quantity.</para>
<para id="fs-idp48158496">Let’s consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one that involves a shift in demand. Then we will consider an example where both supply and demand shift.</para>

<title>Good Weather for Salmon Fishing</title>
<para id="fs-idm96936176">Suppose that during the summer of 2015, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off the California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the salmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply. The ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad weather. How did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon? <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C03_010"/> illustrates the four-step approach, which we explain below, to work through this problem. <link target-id="Table_03_07"/> also provides the information to work the problem.</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_010">

<para id="fs-idm33623968">Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for salmon in the year before the good weather conditions began. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show that the original equilibrium price is $3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000 fish. (This price per pound is what commercial buyers pay at the fishing docks. What consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)</para><para id="fs-idm60200416">Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather is an example of a natural condition that affects supply.</para>
<para id="fs-idp54862544">Step 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good weather is a change in natural conditions that increases the quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the right, moving from the original supply curve S<sub>0</sub> to the new supply curve S<sub>1</sub>, which <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C03_010"/> and <link target-id="Table_03_07"/> show.</para><para id="fs-idm55833264">Step 4.

The result was a higher equilibrium quantity of salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.</para>

<title>Newspapers and the Internet</title>
<para id="fs-idp108309040">According to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Pew Research Center for People and the Press</term>, increasingly more people, especially younger people, are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to access the news. From 2004 to 2012, the share of Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to 39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news? <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C03_011"/> and the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_011">

</figure>

<para id="fs-idm7452320">Step 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the market looked like before the event. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show the original relationships. In this case, we perform the analysis without specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.</para><para id="fs-idm103615536">Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? A change in tastes, from traditional news sources (print, radio, and television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the former.</para><para id="fs-idm63975312">Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to digital news sources will tend to mean a lower quantity demanded of traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand curve for print and other traditional news sources to shift to the left, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm25008960">Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).</para>
<para id="fs-idp13978336">The decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper circulation peaked in 1973 and has declined since then due to competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of Americans indicated they received their news from print sources, while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar path in recent decades, with the share of Americans obtaining their news from radio declining from 54% in 1991 to 33% in 2012. Television news has held its own in recent years, with a market share staying in the mid to upper fifties. What does this suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old say they do not obtain their news from television at all?</para></section>

<title>The Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets</title>
<para id="fs-idm116209728">In the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can change all at once. For example, the demand for cars might increase because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease because of rising gasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise, the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new technologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might decrease as a result of new government regulations requiring the installation of costly pollution-control technology.</para>
<para id="fs-idm172967584">Moreover, rising incomes and population or changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars. How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The answer lies in the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002"><emphasis effect="italics">ceteris paribus</emphasis></term> assumption. Look at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else constant. Then combine the analyses to see the net effect.</para></section>

<para id="fs-idm21376496">Following are the results:</para>
<para id="fs-idm31866688">Effect on Quantity: The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services because it raises the cost of production is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium quantity.

This is easy to see graphically, since Q<sub>3</sub> is to the left of Q<sub>0</sub>.</para><para id="fs-idm130423904">Effect on Price: The overall effect on price is more complicated. The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services, because it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium price. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in opposite directions, unless we know the magnitudes of the two effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual. When both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on price or on quantity, but not on both. In this case, we determined the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the equilibrium price. In other cases, it might be the opposite.</para><para id="fs-idm130104928">The next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between shifts of supply or demand and movements along a curve.</para><note id="fs-idp22029344" class="economics clearup">
<title>What is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus movements along a demand or supply curve?</title>
<para id="fs-idm12550704">One common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to confuse the shift of a demand or a supply curve with movement along a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that asks whether a drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an introductory economics class, might reason:</para>
<para id="fs-idp41575248">“Well, it is clear that a drought reduces supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from the original supply curve S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub> on the diagram (Shift 1). The equilibrium moves from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">equilibrium quantity</term> is lower and the equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good, so the supply curve shifts right, as shows the shift from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>2</sub>, shows on the diagram (Shift 2), so that the equilibrium now moves from E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>. The higher price, however, also reduces demand and so causes demand to shift back, like the shift from the original demand curve, D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> on the diagram (labeled Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>3</sub>.”</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_018">

<caption>A shift in one curve never causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve causes a movement along the second curve.</caption>
</figure>

<para id="fs-idm182884000">At about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong with Lee’s logic, and then read the answer that follows.</para>
<para id="fs-idm146235232"><emphasis effect="italics">Answer:</emphasis> Lee’s first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction of a lower equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This corresponds to a movement along the original demand curve (D<sub>0</sub>), from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>. The rest of Lee’s argument is wrong, because it mixes up shifts in supply with quantity supplied, and shifts in demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts the supply curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>2</sub>. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given supply curve. Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as suggested in the shift from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.</para>
<para id="fs-idm194383488">Think carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first, what happens next? What is cause, what is effect? If you keep the order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.</para>
</note>


<para id="fs-idm162362848">In the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium price and quantity, the movement from the old to the new equilibrium seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not zoom straight to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift, prices and quantities set off in the general direction of equilibrium. Even as they are moving toward one new equilibrium, a subsequent change in demand or supply often pushes prices toward another equilibrium.</para></section>
