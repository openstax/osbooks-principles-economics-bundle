<para id="fs-idm116325952">Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and coordinates this system? Who ensures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants? Who ensures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who ensures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get done? </para>
<para id="fs-idm2603472">There are at least three ways that societies organize an economy. The first is the <term id="term-00001">traditional economy</term>, which is the oldest economic system and is used in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family. Most families are farmers who grow the crops using traditional methods. What you produce is what you consume. Because tradition drives the way of life, there is little economic progress or development. </para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_005">
<title>A Command Economy</title>

    </figure>

<para id="fs-idm22896400">Command economies are very different. In a <term id="term-00002">command economy</term>, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those in <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C01_005" document=""/>, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and soldiers to do the lord’s bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies. </para><para id="fs-idp38251936">In a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices it will charge for them. The government decides what methods of production to use and sets wages for workers. The government provides many necessities like healthcare and education for free. Currently, Cuba and North Korea have command economies. </para>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_006"><title>A Market Economy</title><media id="fs-idm54412752" alt="The image is a photograph of the New York Stock Exchange’s entrance">

  </figure>
    <para id="fs-idp41834384">Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A <term id="term-00003">market</term> is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (<link target-id="CNX_Econ_C01_006" document=""/>) is a prime example of a market which brings buyers and sellers together. In a <term id="term-00004">market economy</term>, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies are based on <term id="term-00005">private enterprise</term>: the private individuals or groups of private individuals own and operate the means of production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, the government owns resources and businesses.) Supply of goods and services depends on what the demands are. A person’s income is based on their ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values the person’s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James).  In this scenario, market forces, not governments, determine economic decisions.  </para><para id="fs-idm91198544">Most economies in the real world are mixed. They combine elements of command and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several decades have moved more in the direction of having a market-oriented system, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. The Heritage Foundation provides  perspective on countries’ economic freedom, as the following Clear It Up feature discusses. </para><note id="fs-idm78296032" class="economics clearup"><title>What countries are considered economically free?</title><para id="fs-idp651728">Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the <emphasis effect="italics">Wall Street Journal</emphasis> look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category. Note that while the Heritage Foundation/WSJ index is widely cited by an array of scholars and publications, it should be regarded as only one viewpoint. Some experts indicate that the index’s category choices and scores are politically biased. However, the index and others like it provide a useful resource for critical discussion of economic freedom. </para><para id="fs-idp12476384">The 2016 Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world: <link target-id="Table_01_01" document=""/> lists some examples of the most free and the least free countries. Although technically not a separate country, Hong Kong has been granted a degree of autonomy such that, for purposes of measuring economic statistics, it is often treated as a separate country. Several additional countries were not ranked because of extreme instability that made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. </para><para id="fs-idm133563488">The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been a <emphasis effect="italics">higher level of economic freedom around the world</emphasis>. </para><table id="Table_01_01" summary="This table has two columns and ten rows.

<title>Regulations: The Rules of the Game</title>
<para id="fs-idp121002496">Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the “rules of the game” in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer regulations—ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? The government heavily regulates decisions of what to produce and prices to charge. Heavily regulated economies often have <term id="term-00006">underground economies</term> (or black markets), which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government’s approval. </para><para id="fs-idp9942944">The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a straightforward choice between all market or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market freedom and government rules. </para>

<section id="fs-idm87109856"><title>The Rise of Globalization</title><para id="fs-idm66053168">Recent decades have seen a trend toward <term id="term-00007">globalization</term>, which is the expanding cultural, political, and economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders—in other words, international trade and financial capital flows. </para>
<para id="fs-idm185091664">Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship in <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C01_007" document=""/>, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information—for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade. </para><para id="fs-idm189846048"><link target-id="Table_01_02" document=""/> presents one measure of globalization.

<caption>(Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/)</caption></table><para id="fs-idm154635744">In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries. </para>
<para id="fs-idm149456880"><link target-id="Table_01_02" document=""/> indicates that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades.
