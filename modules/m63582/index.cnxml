<para id="fs-idp136951760"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">John Maynard Keynes</term> (1883–1946), one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking. Keynes (<link target-id="CNX_Econ_C01_004" document=""/>) famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist’s book: “[Economics] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.” In other words, economics teaches you how to think, not what to think. </para><note id="fs-idp57248112" class="economics linkup"><para id="fs-idp159987488">Watch this <link url="http://openstax.org/l/Keynes">video</link> about John Maynard Keynes and his influence on economics.</para>

    </note><para id="fs-idp34661824">Economists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners of any other discipline.  They analyze issues and problems using economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior. These assumptions tend to be different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A <term id="term-00002">theory</term> is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other.   The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to understand, while complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation you are studying. </para><para id="fs-idp129892576">Sometimes economists use the term <term id="term-00003">model</term> instead of theory.  Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model is a more applied or empirical representation.  We use models to test theories, but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably. </para><para id="fs-idp7072">For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product, but can still demonstrate how the new product will work. </para><para id="fs-idp123790320">A good model to start with in economics is the <term id="term-00004">circular flow diagram</term> (<link target-id="CNX_Econ_C01_002" document=""/>). It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups—households and firms—that interact in two markets: the <term id="term-00005">goods and services market</term> in which firms sell and households buy and the <term id="term-00006">labor market</term> in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees. </para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_002"><title>The Circular Flow Diagram</title><media id="fs-idm122026608" alt="The circular flow diagram’s outer arrows represent a goods and services market, and the inner arrows represent a labor market. As illustrated by the outer arrows, in a goods and services market, firms give goods and services to households and, in exchange, households give payment to firms. As illustrated by the inner arrows, in a labor market, households provide labor to firms and, in exchange, firms give wages, salaries, and benefits to households.">

    <caption>The circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the goods and services market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that in the goods and services market, households receive goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market, households provide labor and receive payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits.</caption></figure><para id="eip-417">Firms produce and sell goods and services to households in the market for goods and services (or product market).  Arrow “A” indicates this.  Households pay for goods and services, which becomes the revenues to firms.  Arrow “B” indicates this.  Arrows A and B represent the two sides of the product market.  Where do households obtain the income to buy goods and services? They provide the labor and other resources (e.g., land, capital, raw materials) firms need to produce goods and services in the market for inputs (or factors of production).  Arrow “C” indicates this.  In return, firms pay for the inputs (or resources) they use in the form of wages and other factor payments.  Arrow “D” indicates this.  Arrows “C” and “D” represent the two sides of the factor market.
</para><para id="fs-idp5860544">Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many different types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the diagram, firms produce goods and services, which they sell to households in return for revenues. The outer circle shows this, and represents the two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and services) in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell their labor as workers to firms in return for wages, salaries, and benefits. The inner circle shows this and represents the two sides of the labor market in which households supply and firms demand. </para><para id="fs-idp44237760">This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain how the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we wanted to introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the rest of the globe (imports and exports). </para>
<para id="fs-idp5279008">Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then they use the theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. Economists express theories as diagrams, graphs, or even as mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.) Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too long you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph to solve. We explain both micro and macroeconomics in terms of theories and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply and demand, but you will learn a number of others. </para><section id="fs-idp14982192" class="summary">
<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idp896016">Economists analyze problems differently than do other disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use are economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a tool for determining the answer. </para>
