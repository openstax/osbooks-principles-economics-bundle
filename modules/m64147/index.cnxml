<para id="fs-idp42760480">A few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical items that planes, trains, and trucks transported between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade. Economists call this measurement the <term id="term-00001">merchandise trade balance</term>. In most high-income economies, including the United States, goods comprise less than half of a country’s total production, while services comprise more than half. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services, powered by technological advances in telecommunications and computers that have made it possible to export or import customer services, finance, law, advertising, management consulting, software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global trade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the government announces and the media prominently report the merchandise trade balance. Old habits are hard to break. Economists, however, typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the <term id="term-00002">current account balance</term> which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid.</para><section id="fs-idp90728032"><title>Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance</title><para id="fs-idm13487680"><link target-id="Table_23_01"/> breaks down the four main components of the U.S. current account balance for the last quarter of 2015 (seasonally adjusted). The first line shows the merchandise trade balance; that is, exports and imports of goods. Because imports exceed exports, the trade balance in the final column is negative, showing a merchandise trade deficit. We can explain how the government collects this trade information in the following Clear It Up feature.</para><table id="Table_23_01" summary="This table has four columns and five rows. The first row is a header row and it labels each column, “Exports (money flowing into the United States),” “Imports (money flowing out of the United States),” and “Balance.” Under the “Exports (money flowing into the United States)” column are the values: Goods $410.0; Services $180.4; Income receipts and payments $203.0; Unilateral transfers $27.3; and Current account balance $820.7.

<title>How does the U.S. government collect trade statistics?</title>
<para id="fs-idp122455152">Do not confuse the balance of trade (which tracks imports and exports), with the current account balance, which includes not just <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">exports</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">imports</term>, but also income from investment and transfers.</para>
<para id="fs-idp52166640">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)</term> within the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">U.S. Department of Commerce</term> compiles statistics on the balance of trade using a variety of different sources. Merchandise importers and exporters must file monthly documents with the Census Bureau, which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure international trade in services—which can happen over a telephone line or computer network without shipping any physical goods—the BEA carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys tracks investment flows, and there are even specific surveys to collect travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico. For measuring unilateral transfers, the BEA has access to official U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey of charitable organizations that make foreign donations.</para><para id="fs-idp29093376">The BEA then cross-checks this information on international flows of goods and capital against other available data. For example, the Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which it can use to check the data on trade in goods. All companies involved in international flows of capital—including banks and companies making financial investments like stocks—must file reports, which  the U.S. Department of the Treasury ultimately checks. The BEA also can cross check information on foreign trade by looking at data collected by other countries on their foreign trade with the United States, and also at the data collected by various international organizations. Take these data sources, stir carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much of the statistics that we cite in this chapter come from these sources.</para></note>

<para id="fs-idp80239584">The second row of <link target-id="Table_23_01"/> provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy is running a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">surplus</term>. Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For example, U.S. exports of services were equal to about one-half of U.S. exports of goods in 2020, compared to one-fifth in 1980.</para><para id="fs-idp98558512">The third component of the current account balance, labeled “<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">income payments</term>,” refers to money that U.S. financial investors received on their foreign investments (money flowing into the United States) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United States). The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is that, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an economic transaction as car, wheat, or oil shipments: it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market.</para><para id="fs-idp24177728">The final category of the current account balance is <term id="term-00009">unilateral transfers</term>, which are payments that government, private charities, or individuals make in which they send money abroad without receiving any direct good or service. Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category, as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an individual in the United States sends money overseas, as is the case with some immigrants, it is also counted in this category. The current account balance treats these unilateral payments like imports, because they also involve a stream of payments leaving the country. For the U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always negative. This pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when the United States led an international coalition against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they would make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war expenses. These payments were large enough that, in 1991, the overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10 billion.</para><para id="fs-idm19733200">The following Work It Out feature steps you through the process of using the values for goods, services, and income payments to calculate the merchandise balance and the current account balance.</para>
