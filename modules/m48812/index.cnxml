<para id="Ch32Mod01P01">The national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse. Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">GDP per capita</term>, to quantify this diversity. You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations. As explained in <link document="m48705">The Macroeconomic Perspective</link>, we must consider using <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">purchasing power parity</term> or “international dollars” to convert average incomes into comparable units. Purchasing power parity, as formally defined in <link document="m48776">Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows</link>, takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries.</para><para id="Ch32Mod01P02"><link document="m48705">The Macroeconomic Perspective</link> explained how to measure GDP, the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living, and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution. In China's case, for example, China ranks as the second largest global economy, second to only the United States, with Japan being third. But, when we take China's GDP of $9.2 trillion and divide it by its population of 1.4 billion, then the per capita GDP is only $6,900, which is significantly lower than that of Japan, at $38,500, and that of the United States, at $52,800.  Measurement issues aside, it’s worth repeating that the goal, then, is to not only increase GDP, but to strive toward increased GDP per capita to increase overall standards of living for individuals. As we have learned from <link document="m48713">Economic Growth</link>, this can be achieved at the national level by designing policies that increase worker productivity, deepen capital, and advance technology.</para><para id="Ch32Mod01P03">GDP per capita also allows us to rank countries into high-, middle-, or low-income groups. Low-income countries are those with $1,025 per capita GDP per year; middle-income countries have a per capita GDP between $1,025 and $12,475; while high-income countries have over $12,475 per year per capita income. As seen in <link target-id="Ch32Mod01Tab01"/> and <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C32_002"/>, high-income countries earn 68% of world income, but represent just 12% of the global population. Low-income countries earn 1% of total world income, but represent 18.5% of global population.</para><table id="Ch32Mod01Tab01" summary="This table has five columns and four rows.

<caption>The pie charts show the GDP (from 2011) for countries categorized into low, middle, or high income. Low-income are those earning less than $1,025 (less than 1% of global income). They represent 18.5% of the world population. Middle-income countries are those with per capita income of $1,025–$12,475 (31.1% of global income). They represent 69.5% of world population. High-income countries have 68.3% of global income and 12% of the world’s population.

As <link target-id="Ch32Mod01Tab02"/> shows, nominal GDP per capita in 2012 for the 581.4 million people living in Latin America and the Caribbean region was $9,190, which far exceeds that of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In turn, people in the high-income nations of the world, such as those who live in the European Union nations or North America, have a per capita GDP three to four times that of the people of Latin America. To put things in perspective, North America and the European Union have slightly more than 9% of the world’s population, but they produce and consume close to 70% of the world’s GDP.</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C32_003"><title>GDP Per Capita in U.S. Dollars (2008)</title><media id="mCNX_Econ_C32_003" alt="This image is a colored map of the world with only a few areas having high GDPs.">

</table><para id="Ch32Mod01P05">Such comparisons between regions are admittedly rough. After all, per capita GDP cannot fully capture the quality of life. Many other factors have a large impact on the standard of living, like health, education, human rights, crime and personal safety, and environmental quality. These measures also reveal very wide differences in the standard of living across the regions of the world. Much of this is correlated with per capita income, but there are exceptions. For example, life expectancy at birth in many low-income regions approximates those who are more affluent. The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">standards of living</term>. For instance, despite very high income levels, there is still undernourishment in Europe and North America.</para><note id="Ch32Mod01Link01" class="economics linkup"><label/>
<para id="Ch32Mod01P06">Economists know that there are many factors that contribute to your standard of living. People in high-income countries may have very little time due to heavy workloads and may feel disconnected from their community. Lower-income countries may be more community centered, but have little in the way of material wealth. It is hard to measure these characteristics of standard of living. The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development has developed the “OECD Better Life Index.” Visit this <link url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/standofliving">website</link> to see how countries measure up to your expected standard of living.</para><media id="Ch32Mod01QR01" alt="QR Code representing a URL">

</note><para id="Ch32Mod01P07">The differences in economic statistics and other measures of well-being, substantial though they are, do not fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries. Aside from the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">neoclassical determinants of growth</term>, four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and are worth mentioning: geography, demography, industrial structure, and institutions.</para><para id="Ch32Mod01P08"><emphasis>Geographic and Demographic Differences</emphasis></para>
<para id="Ch32Mod01P09">Countries have geographic differences: some have extensive coastlines, some are landlocked. Some have large rivers that have been a path of commerce for centuries, or mountains that have been a barrier to trade. Some have deserts, some have rain forests. These differences create different positive and negative opportunities for commerce, health, and the environment.</para>
<para id="Ch32Mod01P10">Countries also have considerable differences in the age distribution of the population. Many high-income nations are approaching a situation by 2020 or so in which the elderly will form a much larger share of the population. Most low-income countries still have a higher proportion of youth and young adults, but by about 2050, the elderly populations in these low-income countries are expected to boom as well. These demographic changes will have considerable impact on the standard of living of the young and the old.</para><para id="Ch32Mod01P11"><emphasis>Differences in Industry Structure and Economic Institutions</emphasis></para>
<para id="Ch32Mod01P12">Countries have differences in industry structure. In the high-income economies of the world, only about 2% of GDP comes from agriculture; the average for the rest of the world is 12%. Countries have strong differences in degree of urbanization.</para>
<para id="Ch32Mod01P13">Countries also have strong differences in economic institutions: some nations have economies that are extremely market-oriented, while other nations have command economies. Some nations are open to international trade, while others use tariffs and import quotas to limit the impact of trade. Some nations are torn by long-standing armed conflicts; other nations are largely at peace. There are differences in political, religious, and social institutions as well.</para>
<para id="Ch32Mod01P14">No nation intentionally aims for a low standard of living, high rates of unemployment and inflation, or an unsustainable trade imbalance. However, nations will differ in their priorities and in the situations in which they find themselves, and so their policy choices can reasonably vary, too. The next modules will discuss how nations around the world, from high income to low income, approach the four macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade.</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="Ch32Mod01P15">Macroeconomic policy goals for most countries strive toward low levels of unemployment and inflation, as well as stable trade balances. Countries are analyzed based on their GDP per person and ranked as low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Low-income are those earning less than $1,025 (less than 1%) of global income. They currently have 18.5% of the world population. Middle-income countries are those with per capital income of $1,025–$12,475 (31.1% of global income). They have 69.5% of world population. High-income countries are those with per capita income greater than $12,475 (68.3% of global income). They have 12% of the world’s population. Regional comparisons tend to be inaccurate because even countries within those regions tend to differ from each other.</para></section>
