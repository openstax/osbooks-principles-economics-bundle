  <para id="fs-idp60744976">Sustained long-term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity, which essentially means how well we do things. In other words, how efficient is your nation with its time and workers? <term id="term-00001">Labor productivity</term> is the value that each employed person creates per unit of their input. The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the Canadians are more productive. More productivity essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time. This in turn frees up resources for workers to use elsewhere.</para><para id="fs-idm75246784">What determines how productive workers are? The answer is pretty intuitive. The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital. <term id="term-00002">Human capital</term> is the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience), skills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses. Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity.</para>
  <para id="fs-idm112616864">The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change. <term id="term-00003">Technological change</term> is a combination of <term id="term-00004">invention</term>—advances in knowledge—and <term id="term-00005">innovation</term>, which is putting those advances to use in a new product or service. For example, the transistor was invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it. Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart-phones, computers, and escalators. Developing the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices. People can use these devices to communicate with other workers, measure product quality or do any other task in less time, improving worker productivity.</para><para id="fs-idm88141104">The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size. (Read more about economies of scale in <link document="m63680">Production, Cost and Industry Structure</link>.) Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour. If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale, it could be that the Canadian worker had access to a large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a standard residential size oven.</para><para id="fs-idp59009248">Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity, let’s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity.</para>
  <section id="fs-idp131994656"><title>Sources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function</title>
  <para id="fs-idp1057376">To analyze the sources of economic growth, it is useful to think about a <term id="term-00006">production function</term>, which is the technical relationship by which economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials are turned into outputs like goods and services that consumers use. A microeconomic production function describes a firm's or perhaps an industry's inputs and outputs. In macroeconomics, we call the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy an <term id="term-00007">aggregate production function</term>.</para></section>
  
  <section id="fs-idp72654720"><title>Components of the Aggregate Production Function</title>
  <para id="fs-idp129571360">Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies. <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C20_003"/> presents two examples of aggregate production functions. In the first production function in <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C20_003"/> (a), the output is GDP. The inputs in this example are workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology. We discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of Economic Growth.</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C20_003"><title>Aggregate Production Functions </title><media id="fs-idp57433072" alt="The first illustration shows that workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology produce GDP.

    <caption>An aggregate production function shows what goes into producing the output for an overall economy. (a) This aggregate production function has GDP as its output. (b) This aggregate production function has GDP per capita as its output. Because we calculate it on a per-person basis, we already figure the labor input into the other factors and we do not need to list it separately.</caption></figure></section>
  <section id="fs-idp2749200"><title>Measuring Productivity</title>
  <para id="fs-idm219632">An economy’s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the two are not identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases, GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected. Over the long term, the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital.</para>
  <para id="fs-idm117036800">A common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer’s output. This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U.S. economy. <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C20_009"/> shows an index of output per hour, with 2012 as the base year (when the index equals 100). The index equaled 110.5 in 2020. In 1977, the index equaled about 50, which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then.</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C20_009"><title>Output per Hour Worked in the U.S. Economy, 1947–2020</title><media id="fs-idp6068608" alt="The graph shows that output per hour has steadily increased since 1960, when it was 32, to 2014, when it was 106.148.">

    <caption>Output per hour worked is a measure of worker productivity. In the U.S. economy, worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1960s and the mid-1990s compared with the 1970s and 1980s. However, these growth-rate differences are only a few percentage points per year. Look carefully to see them in the changing slope of the line. The average U.S. worker produced over twice as much per hour in 2020 than they did in the 1970s.

    <caption>U.S. growth in worker productivity was very high between 1947 and 1973. It then declined to lower levels in the later 1970s and the 1980s. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw productivity rebound, but then productivity sagged a bit between 2001 and 2020. Some think the productivity rebound of the late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a “new economy” built on higher productivity growth, but we cannot determine  this until more time has passed.

  <section id="fs-idp124756960"><title>The “New Economy” Controversy</title>
  <para id="fs-idp171750800">In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in the second half of the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a “new economy” based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s. The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come. The pessimists, alternatively, argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer anything about long-term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s, because the steep 2008-2009 recession, with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment, complicates any interpretation. While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down over the last decade.</para><para id="fs-idp123959040"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Productivity growth</term> is also closely linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced, then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced, those employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run, productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy. To learn how to compare economies in this regard, follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature.</para>

  <section id="fs-idm165954064"><title>The Power of Sustained Economic Growth</title>
  <para id="fs-idp4367424">Nothing is more important for people’s standard of living than sustained economic growth. Even small changes in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded over long periods of time, make an enormous difference in the standard of living. Consider <link target-id="Table_20_03"/>, in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time. Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future:</para><equation class="unnumbered" id="fs-idm69555584"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mtext>GDP at starting date × (1 + growth rate of GDP)</mtext><mtext>years</mtext></msup><mtext> = GDP at end date</mtext></math></equation>
  <para id="fs-idm124631072" xmlns="http://cnx.rice.edu/cnxml">For example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years; that is, 100 (1.03)<sup>25</sup> = 209.</para>
  <para id="fs-idm36351808">The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1% per year, is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second highest rate, 3% per year, is close to what the U.S. economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Higher rates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8% per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan, Korea, and China.</para>
  <para id="fs-idm142898656"><link target-id="Table_20_03"/> shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy growing at a 1% annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example. However, a country growing at a 5% annual rate will see (almost) the same amount of growth—from 100 to 163—over just 10 years. Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation. (See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates.) If the rate of growth is 8%, young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30, and grow more than sixfold by the time they reach age 45.</para><table id="Table_20_03" summary="This table has five rows and four columns. the first row is a header row and it labels each column “Growth Rate”, “Value of an original 100 in 10 years”, “Value of an original 100 in 25 years”, and “Value of an original 100 in 50 years”.

  <para id="fs-idp62019152">We can measure productivity, the value of what is produced per worker, or per hour worked, as the level of GDP per worker or GDP per hour. The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989. Since then, U.S. productivity has rebounded for the most part, but annual growth in productivity in the nonfarm business sector has been less than one percent each year between 2011 and 2016. It is not clear what productivity growth will be in the coming years. The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy’s rate of long-term economic growth and higher wages. Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy, like human capital, physical capital, and technology, lead to the output measured as GDP per capita.</para><para id="fs-idm32606464">Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates. Seemingly small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time.</para>
