The second edition includes many current examples and recent data from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), which are presented in a politically equitable way. The outcome is a balanced approach to the theory and application of economics concepts.
The second edition was developed with significant feedback from current users.  In nearly all chapters, it follows the same basic structure of the first edition.</para><section id="eip-887"><title>Coverage and scope</title><para id="eip-617">For the second edition, we received expansive and actionable feedback from hundreds of adopters who had used the book for several academic terms. These knowledgeable instructors informed the pedagogical courses, learning objective development and fulfillment, and the chapter arrangements. Faculty who taught from the material provided critical and detailed commentary.</para><para id="eip-id1169327261430">The result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. We strove to balance theory and application, as well as the amount of calculation and mathematical examples.  </para><para id="eip-734">The book is organized into six main parts:</para><list id="eip-679"><item><emphasis>What is Economics?</emphasis>  The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a world of scarce resources.</item>
<item><emphasis>Supply and Demand</emphasis>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics — supply, demand, and equilibrium — before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</item>
<item><emphasis>Elasticity and Price</emphasis>, Chapter 5, introduces and explains elasticity and price, two key concepts in economics.</item>
<item><emphasis>The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</emphasis>, Chapters 6 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</item>
<item><emphasis>Microeconomic Policy Issues</emphasis>, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, and public economy.</item>

<item><emphasis>International Economics</emphasis>, Chapters 19 and 20, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

</item></list><para id="eip-766"><title>Alternate sequencing </title><emphasis effect="italics">Principles of Microeconomics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses 2e</emphasis> was conceived and written to fit a particular topical sequence, but it can be used flexibly to accommodate other course structures. One such potential structure, which fits reasonably well with the textbook content, is provided. Please consider, however, that the chapters were not written to be completely independent, and that the proposed alternate sequence should be carefully considered for student preparation and textual consistency.

</para></section><section id="eip-4"><title>Changes to the second edition</title><para id="eip-272">OpenStax only undertakes revisions when significant modifications to a text are necessary. In the case of <emphasis effect="italics">Principles of Microeconomics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</emphasis>, we received a wealth of constructive feedback.  Many of the book’s users felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The major changes are summarized below.</para><list id="eip-447"><item>Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more comprehensive and informative foundation for the book. </item> 
<item>A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a consumer should choose.</item>
<item>The labor markets chapter and the poverty and economic inequality chapter have been resequenced.</item> 
<item>Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced to provide more relevant and useful information for students.</item>   
<item>Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis around that data, have been thoroughly updated.</item> </list><para id="eip-318">Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) was included and referenced.  In most of these uses, links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly.  

</para><para id="eip-594">Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book.  They reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics.  For issues that may change in the months or years following the textbook's publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation, but we will update the text annually to address further changes. </para><para id="eip-204">The revision of <emphasis effect="italics">Principles of Microeconomics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</emphasis> was undertaken by Steven Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington) and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel MacDonald (California State University, San Bernardino).</para></section><section id="eip-27"><title>Pedagogical foundation</title><para id="eip-987">Throughout <emphasis effect="italics">Principles of Microeconomics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses 2e</emphasis>, you will find features that engage the students in economic inquiry and support the understanding required of the students for the AP<sup>®</sup> exam. Our features include:
</para><list id="eip-213"><item><emphasis>Bring It Home:</emphasis> This feature presents a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter’s main topic to the real world. It is broken into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the Intro module) and the second at chapter’s end, when students have learned what’s necessary to understand the case and “bring home” the chapter’s core concepts.</item>
<item><emphasis>Work It Out:</emphasis> This feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem and guides the students step-by-step to find out how its solution is derived. </item>
<item><emphasis>Clear It Up:</emphasis> This feature addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</item>
<item><emphasis>Link It Up:</emphasis> This feature offers a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students’ understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </item></list></section><section id="eip-651"><title>Questions for each level of learning</title><para id="eip-454"><emphasis effect="italics">Principles of Microeconomics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses 2e</emphasis> offers four types of end-of-module questions for students.  
</para><list id="eip-284"><item><emphasis>Self-Checks</emphasis> are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module.  They push the student to think beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </item>
<item><emphasis>Review Questions</emphasis> are simple recall questions from the chapter and are in open-response format (<emphasis effect="underline">not</emphasis> multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </item>
<item><emphasis>Critical Thinking Questions</emphasis> are higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to demonstrate their understanding by applying what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for reasoning about the concepts in a manner that will help prepare students for the AP<sup>®</sup> exam. </item>
<item><emphasis>Problems</emphasis> are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module. </item></list></section><section id="eip-780"><title>Updated art</title><para id="eip-26"><emphasis effect="italics">Principles of Microeconomics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses 2e</emphasis> includes an updated art program to better inform today’s student, providing the latest data on covered topics.
