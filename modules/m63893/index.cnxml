  <title>Total Utility and Diminishing Marginal Utility</title>
  <para id="fs-idp93391360">To understand how a household will make its choices, economists look at what consumers can afford, as shown in a <term id="term-00002">budget constraint (or budget line)</term>, and the <term id="term-00003">total utility</term> or satisfaction derived from those choices. In a budget constraint line, the quantity of one good is on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good on the vertical axis. The budget constraint line shows the various combinations of two goods that are affordable given consumer income. Consider José's situation, shown in <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C06_001" document=""/>. José likes to collect T-shirts and watch movies. </para><para id="fs-idp31914512">In <link target-id="CNX_Econ_C06_001" document=""/> we show the quantity of T-shirts on the horizontal axis while we show the quantity of movies on the vertical axis. If José had unlimited income or goods were free, then he could consume without limit. However, José, like all of us, faces a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">budget constraint</term>. José has a total of $56 to spend. The price of T-shirts is $14 and the price of movies is $7. Notice that the vertical intercept of the budget constraint line is at eight movies and zero T-shirts ($56/$7=8). The horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is four, where José spends of all of his money on T-shirts and no movies ($56/14=4). The slope of the budget constraint line is rise/run or –8/4=–2. The specific choices along the budget constraint line show the combinations of affordable T-shirts and movies.</para><figure id="CNX_Econ_C06_001"><title>A Choice between Consumption Goods </title><media id="fs-idm9744688" alt="The points on the graph show how a budget is affected by spending choices.

      </figure><para id="fs-idp11885664">José wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">utility</term>, which is the term economists use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction or happiness with their choices.</para><para id="fs-idm12290576">Let’s begin with an assumption, which we will discuss in more detail later, that José can measure his own utility with something called <emphasis effect="italics">utils</emphasis>. (It is important to note that you cannot make comparisons between the utils of individuals. If one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils, this does not mean than the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much. The reason why is that utils are subjective to an individual.  The way one person measures utils is not the same as the way someone else does.) <link target-id="Table_06_02" document=""/> shows how José’s utility is connected with his T-shirt or movie consumption. The first column of the table shows the quantity of T-shirts consumed. The second column shows the total utility, or total amount of satisfaction, that José receives from consuming that number of T-shirts. The most common pattern of total utility, in this example, is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility, but at a decreasing rate. The third column shows <term id="term-00006">marginal utility</term>, which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption. This equation for marginal utility is:</para><equation class="unnumbered" id="eip-814"><m:math><m:mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><m:mtr><m:mtd><m:mtext>MU</m:mtext></m:mtd><m:mtd><m:mo>=</m:mo></m:mtd><m:mtd><m:mfrac><m:mtext>change in total utility</m:mtext><m:mtext>change in quantity</m:mtext></m:mfrac></m:mtd></m:mtr></m:mtable></m:math></equation><para id="fs-idm111185456">Notice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed, which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed provides less <emphasis effect="italics">additional</emphasis> utility. For example, the first T-shirt José picks is his favorite and it gives him an addition of 22 utils. The fourth T-shirt is just something to wear when all his other clothes are in the wash and yields only 18 additional utils. This is an example of the law of <term id="term-00007">diminishing marginal utility</term>, which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added. Diminishing marginal utility is another example of the more general law of diminishing returns we learned earlier in the chapter on <link document="m63593">Choice in a World of Scarcity</link>.</para><para id="fs-idp41442160">The rest of <link target-id="Table_06_02" document=""/> shows the quantity of movies that José attends, and his total and marginal utility from seeing each movie. Total utility follows the expected pattern: it increases as the number of movies that José watches rises. Marginal utility also follows the expected pattern: each additional movie brings a smaller gain in utility than the previous one. The first movie José attends is the one he wanted to see the most, and thus provides him with the highest level of utility or satisfaction. The fifth movie he attends is just to kill time. Notice that total utility is also the sum of the marginal utilities. Read the next Work It Out feature for instructions on how to calculate total utility.</para><table id="Table_06_02" summary="The table has columns quantity, total utility, and marginal utility for t-shirts and movies.

  <title>Decision Making by Comparing Marginal Utility</title>
  <para id="fs-idm24118432">José could use the following thought process (if he thought in utils) to make his decision regarding how many T-shirts and movies to purchase:</para>
  <para id="fs-idm94212096">Step 1. From <link target-id="Table_06_02" document=""/>, José can see that the marginal utility of the fourth T-shirt is 18. If José gives up the fourth T-shirt, then he loses 18 utils. </para><para id="fs-idm101265952">Step 2. Giving up the fourth T-shirt, however, frees up $14 (the price of a T-shirt), allowing José to buy the first two movies (at $7 each). </para>
  <para id="fs-idm102172720">Step 3. José knows that the marginal utility of the first movie is 16 and the marginal utility of the second movie is 15. Thus, if José moves from point P to point Q, he gives up 18 utils (from the T-shirt), but gains 31 utils (from the movies).</para>
  <para id="fs-idm122434176">Step 4. Gaining 31 utils and losing 18 utils is a net gain of 13. This is just another way of saying that the total utility at Q (94 according to the last column in <link target-id="Table_06_03" document=""/>) is 13 more than the total utility at P (81). </para>
  <para id="fs-idm157198464">Step 5. Thus, for José, it makes sense to give up the fourth T-shirt in order to buy two movies.</para></note>
  
  <para id="fs-idm148755408">José clearly prefers point Q to point P. Now repeat this step-by-step process of decision making with marginal utilities. José thinks about giving up the third T-shirt and surrendering a marginal utility of 20, in exchange for purchasing two more movies that promise a combined marginal utility of 27. José prefers point R to point Q. What if José thinks about going beyond R to point S? Giving up the second T-shirt means a marginal utility loss of 21, and the marginal utility gain from the fifth and sixth movies would combine to make a marginal utility gain of 23, so José prefers point S to R.</para>
  <para id="fs-idm86729312">However, if José seeks to go beyond point S to point T, he finds that the loss of marginal utility from giving up the first T-shirt is 22, while the marginal utility gain from the last two movies is only a total of 19. If José were to choose point T, his utility would fall to 100. Through these stages of thinking about marginal tradeoffs, José again concludes that S, with one T-shirt and six movies, is the choice that will provide him with the highest level of total utility.

Therefore, José’s first purchase will be the movie.  Why?  Because it gives him the highest marginal utility per dollar and is affordable.  Next, José will purchase another movie.  Why?  Because the marginal utility of the next movie (2.14) is greater than the marginal utility of the next T-shirt (1.6).  Note that when José has no T- shirts, the next one is the first one.  José will continue to purchase the next good with the highest marginal utility per dollar until he exhausts his budget.

If the last T-shirt provides less than twice the marginal utility of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing less “bang for the buck” (i.e., marginal utility per dollar spent) than José would receive from spending the same money on movies. If this is so, José should trade the T-shirt for more movies to increase his total utility.</para><para id="fs-idp46568992">If the last T-shirt provides more than twice the marginal utility of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing more “bang for the buck” or marginal utility per dollar, than if the money were spent on movies.

Notice that at José’s optimal choice of point S, the marginal utility from the first T-shirt, of 22 is exactly twice the marginal utility of the sixth movie, which is 11.

  <title>Measuring Utility with Numbers</title>
  <para id="fs-idp3152848">This discussion of utility began with an assumption that it is possible to place numerical values on utility, an assumption that may seem questionable. You can buy a thermometer for measuring temperature at the hardware store, but what store sells a “utilimometer” for measuring utility? While measuring utility with numbers is a convenient assumption to clarify the explanation, the key assumption is not that an outside party can measure utility but only that individuals can decide which of two alternatives they prefer. </para><para id="fs-idm39008">To understand this point, think back to the step-by-step process of finding the choice with highest total utility by comparing the marginal utility you gain and lose from different choices along the budget constraint. As José compares each choice along his budget constraint to the previous choice, what matters is not the specific numbers that he places on his utility—or whether he uses any numbers at all—but only that he personally can identify which choices he prefers. </para><para id="fs-idm38624">In this way, the step-by-step process of choosing the highest level of utility resembles rather closely how many people make consumption decisions. We think about what will make us the happiest. We think about what things cost. We think about buying a little more of one item and giving up a little of something else. We choose what provides us with the greatest level of satisfaction. The vocabulary of comparing the points along a budget constraint and total and marginal utility is just a set of tools for discussing this everyday process in a clear and specific manner. It is welcome news that specific utility numbers are not central to the argument, since a good utilimometer is hard to find. Do not worry—while we cannot measure utils, by the end of the next module, we will have transformed our analysis into something we can measure—demand. </para></section>

This starting point is arbitrary, but the numbers in this example work best starting from the bottom. Suppose we consider moving to the next point up.

We keep trading round trips for phone minutes until we get to (1, 160), which is the best we can do. The MU/P comparison is as close as it is going to get (40 vs. 70). Often in the real world, it is not possible to get MU/P exactly equal for both products, so you get as close as you can.</para></solution>

  <para id="fs-idm38792752">Praxilla, who lived in ancient Greece, derives utility from reading poems and from eating cucumbers. Praxilla gets 30 units of marginal utility from her first poem, 27 units of marginal utility from her second poem, 24 units of marginal utility from her third poem, and so on, with marginal utility declining by three units for each additional poem. Praxilla gets six units of marginal utility for each of her first three cucumbers consumed, five units of marginal utility for each of her next three cucumbers consumed, four units of marginal utility for each of the following three cucumbers consumed, and so on, with marginal utility declining by one for every three cucumbers consumed. A poem costs three bronze coins but a cucumber costs only one bronze coin. Praxilla has 18 bronze coins. Sketch Praxilla’s budget set between poems and cucumbers, placing poems on the vertical axis and cucumbers on the horizontal axis. Start off with the choice of zero poems and 18 cucumbers, and calculate the changes in marginal utility of moving along the budget line to the next choice of one poem and 15 cucumbers. Using this step-by-step process based on marginal utility, create a table and identify Praxilla’s utility-maximizing choice. Compare the marginal utility of the two goods and the relative prices at the optimal choice to see if the expected relationship holds. <emphasis effect="italics">Hint</emphasis>: Label the table columns: 1) Choice, 2) Marginal Gain from More Poems, 3) Marginal Loss from Fewer Cucumbers, 4) Overall Gain or Loss, 5) Is the previous choice optimal?
